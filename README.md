Toru: Stream Torrents instantly, straight from the Command Line
</h3>

Toru, the command line tool designed for anime enthusiasts. Browse the latest releases on nyaa.si or search for specific titles with Toru's intuitive interface. Stream episodes directly from the command line using MPV or your favorite video player or browser.
Toru serves the selected anime over localhost, making it as accessible as any HTTP link. It also functions as a convenient torrent client for magnet links. Simplify your streaming and torrenting with Toru.

## Install

Quick install a pre-built binary

```sh
export PREFIX="$HOME/bin"
wget "https://github.com/sweetbbak/toru/releases/download/v0.1/toru_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz" -O - | tar -xz
mv toru "${PREFIX}"
```

on Windows

```pwsh
iwr -Uri "https://github.com/sweetbbak/toru/releases/download/v0.1/toru_Windows_x86_64.zip" -OutFile toru_Windows_x86_64.zip
```

With Nix

```sh
nix profile install github:sweetbbak/toru
```

<details closed>
  <summary>Install Go</summary>
  <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install">Install go</a>
  This project requires go 1.21.7 or higher.
</details>

```sh
go install github.com/sweetbbak/toru/cmd/toru@latest
```

<details closed>
  <summary>Build from source</summary>

using Go is recommended alongside `gup` so that it can be easily updated

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sweetbbak/toru.git && cd toru
go build -o toru ./cmd/toru
```

you can also use the justfile

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sweetbbak/toru.git && cd toru
just
```

or the makefile

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sweetbbak/toru.git && cd toru
make build
```

Using `docker`, `podman` with the `shell.nix` file on non-nixOS distros
this will automatically pull the correct version of Go and install `just`
so that building is easy.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sweetbbak/toru.git && cd toru
# mount the project directory inside the container
podman run --volume $(pwd):/toru -ti docker.io/nixos/nix:latest
# inside the container run:
cd /toru
nix-shell
just
```

### Building for different platforms and architectures

Run to find your target architecture and platform:

```sh
go tool dist list
```

then use the environment variables `GOOS` and `GOARCH` before using
the build command.

Example:

```sh
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o toru ./cmd/toru
```

_If you do this_ feel free to create an issue for a platform reporting how it went
So far there is an issue with android and termux as well as arm 6.

</details>

if you are on nix or have nix installed you can just use the shell.nix directly and run `just` or `make`

## Examples

Search for an anime:

```sh
toru search -j "one piece" # outputs json
toru search -i "one piece" # search interactively with fzf
```

![example of toru in progress](assets/search.png)

the selected torrent will begin playing and once the video player is closed
you will have the option to select another episode, make another search query,
or to exit.

#### _View_ the latest anime on nyaa.si in an interactive fzf session

```sh
toru search --latest
```

#### Search for a specific keyword or series

```sh
toru search "Akuyaku"
```

If you know the magnet link for the content you can directly download or stream it

```sh
toru stream --magnet 'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:1...announce'
toru download --magnet 'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:1...announce'
```

All of the above outputs a link that you can use to stream the torrent `'http://localhost:8080/stream?ep=torrent_info_hash'`
you can treat this link like any other http link and stream it with `mpv` or `vlc`, download it, use `yt-dlp`, or open it in the browser etc...

#### Use a proxy Nyaa site

this can be helpful for geoblocking and for browsing "special" Nyaa sites

```sh
toru search --proxy="https://sukebei.nyaa.si" -i
toru search --proxy="https://nyaa.ink.iss" -i
```

### Handling input and output

You can use toru to search for anime and other media types and then output the results in multiple formats.
Output in Json and parsing that output with `jq`:

```sh
toru search --latest --json | jq -r '.[]|.Name,.Magnet'
```

#### Open a cached search session from a json file

```sh
toru search --json "one piece" > cache.json
toru search --from-json cache.json --interactive
```

#### Output in a human readable format:

```sh
toru search "akuyaku 99 1080p"
# Outputs:
[Erai-raws] Akuyaku Reijou Level 99 - 01 [1080p][Multiple Subtitle] [ENG][POR-BR][SPA-LA][SPA][ARA][FRE][GER][ITA][RUS]

```

### Creating your own CLI tool using toru

```sh
# Create a JSON file using toru
toru search --latest --json > out.json
# Here is a simple example of using fzf and toru to create a simple interace to select and play torrents
# you can also replace toru with any CLI bittorrent client
cat out.json | jq '.[].Name' | \
fzf --preview='cat out.json | jq -r ".[{n}]"' \
  --bind "enter:become(cat out.json | jq -r '.[{n}].Magnet')" | \
  xargs toru stream --magnet
```

### Shell completions

_ZSH_

installing bash completions

- Copy the file `_toru` from the `completions` directory into your `$FPATH`

  - `echo $FPATH | sed "s/:/\n/g"` to see a list of directories in your `$FPATH`

- run this command in an interactive shell or put this command in your `.zshrc`

```bash
source <(toru init --zsh)
```

_BASH_

installing bash completions

- Place the file `_toru_bash` from the `completions` directory into your completions path

- run this command in an interactive shell or put it in your `.bashrc`

```bash
source <(toru init --bash)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> toru is in a very early development phase! In order to provide a consistent and smooth experience
> the CLI interface is subject to change. PR's and advice on project sturcture, pkg organization and
> feedback on the UI of toru is much appreciated.
>
> Currently tested on Linux, Mac and Windows
> I would much appreciate someone reporting on the functionality on any BSD, or any other niche device or architecture
> Android with termux currently has UDP issues. Idk much about how android works

## Good issues to work on

- [ ] add a package for your distro
- [ ] fix race condition in UI between progress bar and fzf interface when searching interactively

## Roadmap

- Daemonize into the background and listen for commands on a socket (optional for user, sometimes this is annoying)
- Simple torrent client features (download|seed|add magnet|stream|search)
- Add other trackers besides `nyaa.si`
- Expand user interface with bubbletea

    Fork it!
    Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature

PR's welcome! This project currently uses Golang 1.22.2
make sure to format go files using `gofmt` and `alejandra` for nix. I'm likely to reject PR's that are directly to main unless they are small
or are regarding typos, the readme or documentation.

## Why though?

Because scraping is annoying af and it constantly breaks. On top of that, _someone_ is paying for those servers.
Torrents are more resistant to takedowns and hopefully will have more longevity.
